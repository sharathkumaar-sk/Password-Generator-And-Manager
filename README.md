## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed (Download Python)


Text editor or IDE of your choice (List of Source Code Editors)


### Installation

Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/sharathkumaar/Password-Generator_And_Manager.git]
```

### Setup Database

**Create MySQL Database**
- Access your MySQL server administration tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench).
- Create a new database and name it appropriately (e.g., password_manager).
- Create passwords Table Within the newly created database, execute the following SQL statement to create the passwords table:
```bash
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS passwords (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    app_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password_hash BLOB NOT NULL,
    `key` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```
**Create Database User**
- Create a new user specifically for the password manager application and grant it the necessary privileges.
Important:
Avoid using the root user for application access.
- Grant privileges on the password_manager database (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to this new user.
- Assign a strong password to the newly created user and store it securely (avoid hardcoding passwords in code).
  
**Connect to Database**
- Connecting to the Database in app.py (Secure Method)
- Replace the empty strings in app.py with your actual database credentials. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code to enhance security.
```bash
localhost= ""     # Replace with your database host address
User_Name=""      # Replace with your database username
User_Password=""  # Replace with your database password
Database_Name= "" # Replace with your database name

```
- Save the changes to app.py.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Script

```bash
python app.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to generate passwords, manage your password database, and utilize export functionalities.
